            <h2>Chicken</h2>
            <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.Size and coloration vary widely between breeds. Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.</p>
